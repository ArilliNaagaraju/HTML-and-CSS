<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for </p>
documents designed to be 
displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.<br> It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

<pre>
    HTML is a markup language that web browsers
     use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into 
     visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined
      in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's 
      additional use of CSS. Many
     of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 
     ISO technical <mark>report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML</mark>

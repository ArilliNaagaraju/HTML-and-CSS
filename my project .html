        <p>Once called windmills, the technology used to harness the power of wind has advanced significantly over the past ten years, 
            with the United States increasing its wind power capacity 30% year over year. Wind turbines, as they are now called, collect
             and convert the kinetic energy that wind produces into electricity to help power the grid.</p>

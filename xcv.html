<p>A 7-level NM CHB MLI with SPWM and an LC filter is <mark> 3.<sup>96</sup></mark> and equal phase triggering is 23.10%. A 7 level NM CHB MLI with an LC filter SPWM wave is the simulation's ultimate output. <u> The greatest voltage increases by 89.13%.</u> The final output equal phase triggering wave of a 7 level NM CHB MLI with an LC filter from the simulation. The greatest voltage increases by <mark>78.<sub>23</sub></mark>. It is determined that the SPWM is superior by contrasting it with equal phase triggering.<mark> A significant independent sample t test result of 0.018 (p 0.05) was achieved.</mark>
<i><b>Table 1 depicts the MOSFET switch configuration with seven stages.</b></i> <font size = 19 > Table 2 presents the simulation outcomes for Sinusoidal PWM and Equal Phase triggers.</font> Table 3 displays the results of the T-test comparing SPWM and equal phase triggering. The mean value for the SPWM, which is 73.9000, is greater than the mean value for equal phase triggering. <hr>The average value of equal phase triggering is 71.8189.</hr> In Table 4, the Independent Samples Test and the significant output voltage difference between SPWM and equal phase triggering are displayed, respectively. </p>
